<hr></hr>

<p align="justify">The project was developed with the objective of working with the four pillars of 'OOP' (<strong>abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism</strong>).
 The four pillars were developed by the basis of a situation/problem. "<strong>A bank offers to their customers two types of accounts (checking account and savings account), 
 those which both has deposit, withdraw and transfer (between accounts) methods.</strong>". With that problem being presented, i must find a way of develop a simple and 
 objective software that solves the question !</p>
 
 <p align="justify">The class has been carried out before i made the project and in the path of the course, i took the liberty to take notes and translate them to english in the middle 
 of the class for educational purposes. Hope someone learns something from that :)</p>
